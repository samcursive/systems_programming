# systems_programming

This program is written to simulate CPU scheduling Algorithms. 

The Specific CPU Scheduling Algorithms:

- FCFS
- Shortest Job
- Priority Queue 
- Round Robin (time quanta = 100ms)



### To Compile
I personally used `clang` and `gcc` (on Linux server)
`clang version`: 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.4)

Initially this code was compiled and run using the commands:

- `gcc -g -o test project.c && ./test`
- `clang -g -o test project.c && ./test`


### Gitignore
Setup for C files and manually added the `test` executable there.
